# NKGAME
A PyGame extension library that adds useful features!

# About

NKGAME Is a module that allows features like buttons, rects, text boxes, in-game cameras, and randomly generated terrain to be easilly implemented into the PyGame library.

NKGAME streamlines all the busy work and allows for a more optimized version of PyGame that allows for many things to be automated for you. For example, NKGAME will automatically draw all rects added to the game. Also, NKGAME can create randomly generated terrains insanely fast. 


NKGAME has a in-game camera, that allows for a specific object or rect to be centered in the middle of the screen. This creates a perspective effect of a camera fosucsing on one specific object.
