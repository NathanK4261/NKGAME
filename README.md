# Example Game

This is an example game i made called "Barebones" that uses all the features of the NKGAMe, NKNET, and NKSERVER modules. Your cna download this branch and run it on python, as long as you have PyGame installed.

The game has a server, which handles 2 players. The players just float around right now, there are on collisions happening so far...

Keep in mind this is very unfinished, and I plan to add more features later on.
